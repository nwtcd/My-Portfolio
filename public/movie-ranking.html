<h3>Gilmore Girls</h3>

<p>The story is about a single mother raising her daughter in a small town. I love the dynamic between the mother and daughter throughout the whole show. I can relate to both characters in some ways, creating an attachment to the show.</p>
<h3>Naruto Shippuden</h3>

<p>Easily one of my favorite animes. Naruto Shippuden, specifically. An orphaned child shunned by his village, but his restless spirit drives him to become the greatest shinobi in all the land in order to protect everyone.</p>
<h3>Black Clover</h3>

<p>Another anime with a similar fundamental story as Naruto. A young poor and unlucky child with an burning passion to become the strongest and the best in order to protect everyone against harmful foes. The story mostly focuses on Asta (pictured on the right).</p>
